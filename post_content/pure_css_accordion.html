    Web components are building blocks of any UI, we often find ourselves trying to build one from scratch, 
    when none of the UI libraries out there can suit our project. However, building one from scratch can be 
    a hassle since most components require javascript to make them interactive. In this tutorial, we will build 
    an <b>accordion web component</b> that relies only on html and css, no <b>javascript</b>. But first let's understand 
    what an accordion component is. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Accordion</b> often will show as a list of items, each having a header that allows the user to make 
    them expand or collapse. each item is responsive to the rest, by automatically collapsing as soon as one 
    expands. There are some variations where all the items can stay expand, but in this guide we will stick
    with the former. Now let's discuss our strategy on building this component.
</p>

<p>
    The core of this web component is a an html buil-in component you all know very well, <b>Input with type radio</b>.
    Yes this simple html tag is all we will need to make our accordion web component interactive. Most of you have already used that 
    element, so you are well familiar with its behaviour, but for those who haven't, let's try to explain and 
    understand how this component can be related to an accordion. 
</p>

<p>
    The main function of that element is to allow user to make an exclusive selection, this means if the user is offered 
    multiple option, it can only select one, no more. The <b>input type radio</b> will automatically deactivate any option 
    we haven't selected and keep only the selected one active. You are starting to get how this will be useful for our 
    component, indeed our component will behave the same way and keep only the item the user selects expand, and the rest 
    of them will collapse.

<p>
    All four tags are sharing the same attribute <b>name</b>. This is how html binds the elements together and make them react 
    to each other. We are going to use the input tag as a trigger (accordion header) to expand our item. In order to accomplish 
    that we need to connect each item header to its corresponding input, to do so we will use the <b>label tag</b>. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Label tag</b> is another useful html build-in element we often see in user form. The element basically can be connected 
    to any input tag and will trigger the input response each time it's clicked on, to make the connection, we need to add 
    the <b>for attribute</b> to the label and the corresponding <b>id attribute</b> to the input. 
</p>

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js,result" data-slug-hash="EayPBNq" data-pen-title="input-radio-label" data-user="devspot" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

</p>

<p>
    If you click on the text, it will trigger the input element, the same way it did before. So now we don't need the input tag anymore,
    let's hide them and add some css.
</p>

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js,result" data-slug-hash="MYeKMoL" data-pen-title="accordion-3" data-user="devspot" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

</p>
<script async src="https://public.codepenassets.com/embed/index.js"></script>

<p>
    We are getting close to the final result, we also need all item to collapse by default, let's make sure of that.
</p>

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js,result" data-slug-hash="ogLbrJB" data-pen-title="accordion-4" data-user="devspot" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
    <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/devspot/pen/ogLbrJB">accordion-4</a> by devspot (<a href="https://codepen.io/devspot">@devspot</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://public.codepenassets.com/embed/index.js"></script>

<p>
    In order to make the component reactive, we can rely on css pseudo class selector <b>:checked</b> that allows us to style based on the input state. 
    If you take a look to the html, you will notice the input tag being just on the top of the item body, this will allow us to hide the item body based 
    on the state of the input element that comes just before it. Let's get that done.
</p>

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js,result" data-slug-hash="XJKXLvm" data-pen-title="accordion-5" data-user="devspot" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

</p>
<script async src="https://public.codepenassets.com/embed/index.js"></script>

<p>
    And there you go, the final result, a perfectly functional accordion that relies only on css with transition when the item expands and collapses. 
</p>

<p>
    Even though a component is easy to build this way, it's lacking web accessibility that usually allow the component to be manipulated from the keyboad. 
    Despite that minor defect, this is still a great way to showcase your skills by building simple project.
