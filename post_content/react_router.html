    React is a powerful front end library that is widely adopted and most of the time used
    to handle page interactivity. React comes with a number of features to build your app, 
    in today tutrial we will focus on <b>React Router</b>. 
</p>

<p>
    You can follow along with this pre setup react router app from my github repo 
    <a href="https://github.com/devspotgit/reactrouter.git" target="_blank"><b>react router</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>React Router</b> is a separate library that works in conjunction with React to provide 
    a way for your app to navigate from page to page. Let's clarify one thing, react is still 
    a front end library, the router only simulates a navigation, for a fact, the browser will 
    never load each time the app is redirected to a different page.  
</p>

<h1>BrowserRouter</h1>

<p>
    The first step on activating routing in your react app consist on wrapping your app inside
    <b>BrowserRouter</b> component.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/devspotgit/1f3eadbd7e4b6c7d497c0cd42bee6e71.js"></script>

<p>
    Next let's create some page components. 
</p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/devspotgit/605938d37b381bbf44b69b2c747a9646.js"></script>

<p> 
    Our app will have three main pages, <b>home, about and contact</b>. For the sake of explaining, 
    we put all three components in the same file, but in a real project, it sometimes prefer to have 
    a separate file for each component. 
</p>

<p>
    Now we need to update the main component (App), by adding the navigation as a header. To do so 
    we can use the <b>Link</b> or <b>NavLink</b> component from react router. 
</p>

<h1>Link, NavLink</h1>

<p>
    <b>The Link component</b> as the name suggest allows us to create a link which redirect the app to a 
    specific page when we click on it. <b>NavLink</b> behave the same as <b>Link</b>, with one addiotional 
    feature, it allows us to style the link based on its state, this can be achieved by implementing a call back 
    function to return the appropriate styling for <b>className or style attribute </b> 
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/devspotgit/3e97242037712e014f3b64347c3a0681.js"></script>

<p>
    The <b>to</b> attribute represents the page, the app will be redirected to.
</p>

<p>
    The next step now is to connect each page to each link, so far our links don't do 
    anything when we click on it, to change that we will rely on <b>Route and Routes</b> 
    components.
</p>

<h1>Route and Routes</h1>

<p>
    <b>Routes</b> is the route wrapper for all of our routes, and <b>Route</b> component 
    handles the connection between the link and the component, this is achieved by configuring the 
    <b>path and element</b> attributes with the correct setting. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>path</b> refers to the link, so the value of <b>path</b> should be the same as the 
    attribute <b>to</b> from <b>Link component</b>, and <b>element</b> represents the component 
    the link is connected to. Let's implement that.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/devspotgit/7d5ed1922d8928d235b33c86bd06466d.js"></script>

<p>
    React allows only the selected page to be rendered.
</p>

<h1>Nested route</h1>

<p>
    Now let's talk about nested route, in some scenarios, we would want a page to have inner pages  
    user can navigate through, this is where nested route comes in, it allows us to define 
    inner route inside an existing one.
</p>

<p>
    For our example, let's modify the App component by adding some inner route inside the route <b>About</b>. 
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/devspotgit/a878a61282eb49eb85a2d544f568575a.js"></script>

<p>
    <b>Team and Clients</b> were added as sub page to About, Note that the corresponding component for those two routes 
    must be imported inside the App component.
</p>

<p>
    The same way we did last time, the navigation has to be added to the about page to interact 
    with the inner pages, and finally we need to define the placeholder to where the component will be 
    rendered inside the about page, and this is done through the <b>Outlet</b> Component. Now let's 
    update the about component with those changes.
</p>

    This concludes this tutorial, there are still many features of react router left to explore, this tutorial 
    give the necessary knowlegde to begin. Hope you enjoyed learning along, see you in the next one.
